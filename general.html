                    <h1>About Autism</h1>
                    <p>Autism, often known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a group of disorders marked 
						by difficulties in social skills, repetitive activities, speech, and nonverbal communication. 
						Autism affects 1 in 44 children in the United States today, according to the Centers for Disease Control
					</p>
					<p>
						We now know that there are numerous subtypes of autism, the majority of which are influenced 
						by a mix of genetic and environmental variables. Autism is a spectrum illness, which means that
						each person with autism has their own blend of strengths and challenges. Autism affects 
						how people learn, think, and solve problems in a variety of ways, from highly proficient 
						to severely handicapped. Rare persons with ASD may require a lot of help in their daily life, 
						while others may require less help and, in some situations, none at all

                    <h1> Treatment</h1>
                    <p>There is no one treatment for autism spectrum disorder at the moment (ASD). 
                        However, there are several methods for reducing symptoms and increasing skills. 
                        If people with ASD receive the right therapies and interventions, 
                        they have the best opportunity of utilizing all of their strengths and capabilities.
                        The most successful therapy and interventions are frequently unique to each individual. 
                        Most persons with ASD, on the other hand, benefit from highly organized and specialized programs.
                        Treatment for autism can assist people in everyday tasks and minimize symptoms 
                        in certain circumstances.
                        Early diagnosis and therapies, such as those provided during preschool or before, 
                        have been shown to have a significant favorable impact on symptoms and subsequent skills. </p>
